# Introduction
The Mach1 Spatial SDK includes three components and libraries: 

  - Mach1Encode lib
  - Mach1Decode lib
  - Mach1Transcode lib

This allows developers to design applications that can encode or pan to a spatial audio render from audio streams and/or playback and decode Mach1Spatial 8channel spatial audio mixes with orientation to decode the correct stereo output sum of the user's current orientation. 
The Mach1Transcode lib allows users to safely convert surround/spatial audio mixes to and from the Mach1Spatial or Mach1Horizon formats.
